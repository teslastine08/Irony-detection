#USER# #USER# Maybe that was off set by his incompetency and danger to global stability? idk
"#USER# #USER# Select doctors d not represent the medical community. Also, does that mean that restriction should be abandoned? Does living with the virus mean, masking? Avoiding large gatherings?"
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# That there are complicated cases does not invalidate the point. To say someone looks Caucasian is a meaningful statement. Therefore the biological correlates of that phenotype are a factor in ""race"". And race as purely social is not-viable."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# Metanarrative in the sense used in postmodernism is just that - a lens through which events are interpreted. A story through which events are tied. Whatever the extent, authoritarian progressive leftism is growing at an alarming rate."

"#USER# Also, live in a lawless country like the USA. Or, at least lawless for the wealthy."
"#USER# #USER# Yes, there is no rational argument against abortion. So are you saying that early abortions are okay, but the specific case of partial birth is unacceptable? Because then you have conceded my point, because you are no longer arguing against abortion."
#USER# #USER# #USER# That many historians don’t want to come out and speak against the 1619 Project has to be considered in the context of people being destroyed for speaking critically of efforts deemed to be directed toward black empowerment. UNC has good reason to withhold tenure.

#USER# Is it impossible that black activists do things that are counterproductive to their cause? Is it impossible that a non-black person might notice something counterproductive? Is it possible they could draw attention to it without being accused of being a racist in denial?

"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Mostly yes, but you have to consider if the good outcome in an individual case scales to a universal good. Donating a organ to help another live is good, causes less suffering, but harvesting organs from the unwilling is not a world we would want to live in."

#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I have I said as much. Not going to take up an argument I'm not making.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# With 10 billion administrations, with follow up these mRNA vaccines are comparable to vaccinations that have been around for generations in terms of how many people we’ve got to observe receive them. It sounds like you just looked at one study. #URL#"
#USER# #USER# The data is at odds with that. It's relative wealth inequality at the societal level that causes the problems we see with distrust and unhappiness— among MANY other measures of well being. But we might agree that bringing up the bottom is the most impactful social good.
#USER# #USER# Did he previously say he was convinced that it had a natural origin? Or was he just reacting to the question that framed it that way? Because that's what it looked like.
#USER# They (GOP reps with a clue) know it's not the future. They think it might just be the next election.
#USER# #USER# #USER# No! I was asking if you're aware there are other combination than xx or xy. Genes do not have intentions! Different sex chromosomes combinations are just as natural as xx or xy. That there are other combinations means sex— as defined by chromosomes is not strictly binary.
#USER# #USER# #USER# There has been more than one article this week on breakthrough cases.  Fox highlights them in order to entertain its core following despite the fact that it probably encourages them to doubt the efficacy of vaccines inverse exposes them to greater risk.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# I can see why He'd be banned. promoting vaccine skepticism at this point is Team Virus/Pro-death and illness, pro-economic decline. I know patience is what is called for, but at this point it is SO  hard."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I don't have a polite way of saying you're out to lunch. The research represents, ongoing research, which is good. It is trying to find varying schedules and strengths. It in NO way suggests the vaccine is still experimental."
#USER# I have a neutral public reaction to this picture due to restrictive social conventions.
#USER# Fox News— 0 days without glaring hypocrisy.
"#USER# Oh no, Wallace said something that was not completely partisan! We can't tolerate that! If America needs anything right now it's more unabashed partisan politics."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# Yes, promoting disinformation with lives on the line makes those people partially responsible for those unnecessary deaths."
#USER# And I bet the journalist reflected on the data and how it supported a causal link instead of a coincidental correlation and wasn’t trying to make a sensational headline.
#USER# My view of humanity has changed in the last 4-5 years. I did not realize how easily people could be bought by an evil cause. People dying in such numbers and still people trying their damnedest to throw a spanner in the proverbial gears so they can keep their job.
#USER# I’m sorry about your outcome. But the evidence is clear – on average vaccination is going to prevent worse outcomes. That does not mean that some lesser fraction of people will get Vaxxed and still have the worst possible outcome. There are just fewer of those people.
#USER# I think it this way – there is the liberal left – that’s me! And there is the illiberal left that’s CSJ. I may not agree with my conservative friends (and there’s another marker of liberal left— having conservative friends) but they can exist and not be evil.
#USER# #USER# Apparently God chose the world where this man murders someone.
"#USER# #USER# The CMA? Or were you thinking of some other professional organization, because the CMA seems to think we should 'increase pressure' to get vaccinated, and ""Public health measures remain an important part of our response to COVID-19""."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# There were two impeachments that were motivated by well supported cases of Trump soliciting and getting help from Russia and then soliciting it from Ukraine. This is NOT an equal playing field. The pattern is, Trump  ACTUALLY does what he accuses his opponents of."
"#USER# #USER# It needs to be broken down into probably by vaccine type, non vaccinated probability, infected probably. And compared to the adverse effects associated with getting the virus."
"#USER# I’m not. I’m explaining the ultimate basis for a normative categorization of people which is amended to social protocols that help us sort out personal interactions. That you want to “creepify” that just reveals your hostility, and perhaps ignorance, of the social norms."
#USER# #USER# Did you miss the part when he said he was going to walk with them down to the Capitol to encourage the wavering GOP congressmen?
"#USER# Misinformation about the vaccine; cover ups, financial incentives."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# And it's from such a credible source, I don't know why I'm not tweeting, and sharing this important message on all my social media."

#USER# #USER# I've watched his shows previously. And none of what you've said is relevant.
"#USER# Yet, fact checkers are a more reliable metric than the popular — some guy on social media I read a few days ago."
"#USER# Mask, social distancing and lock downs spread out the case load. hospitals have finite resources. we have the assurance of many workers and investigators that capacity was nearly reached and exceeded (necessitating tents and such) in many cases. #URL#"
"#USER# #USER# #USER# The lab leak hypothesis didn't any help. If you're an investigator speaking to the public, you acknowledge the possibility and talk about how we'll follow the evidence. Given history finding out is likely to take time if ever. Remember SARS 2003? We still don't know."
"#USER# As long as the super rich can continue to accumulate wealth so vast that they cannot even spend it in a human life time, I think it's all worth it."
#USER# Why would you ever want to talk live? Only if you're posing for status. Both countries would benefit from behind the scenes talks.
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# What’s the specific question you want addressed by the source?
#USER# #USER# And you will be wrong to the extent that some people say things that racist say despite not being racist.
#USER# #USER# Sounds like you would benefit from some expert guidance through this data.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# It's early so it is tentative claims and reports. It seems unlikely to me that the IDF would take out press just to reduce reporters' ability to report, but I can't claim to know that is the case. WP claim they were ordered to evacuate."
#USER# #USER# #USER# You don't know what that would have caused; pretending you do is just hubris.

"#USER# #USER# #USER# What about XXY? What about XYY? What about XY, but gonadotrophin is blocked? And they develop as a female?"
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I've lived 2-decades in Korea but I'm from Canada. I also did my MSc. Lpool comparing attitudes towards aggression between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Revering individual rights to the point that people die is obscene. It's an extremist ideology.
#USER# #USER# Not quite. The ones who remain will be more fervent. Some will leave the belief. That’s what Festinger et al found when UFO cultists were faced with disproof.  That’s what happened when Mao’s followers faced prolonged failures.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Sure, just tracking these issue in the longer term is often clarifying."
Your headline betrays your bias. The investigation isn't finished?
#USER# Doesn't it? Assuming it's working in the public interest its authority is justified.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I don't agree. The mind is a funny thing. An activity may be racism on one level of analysis, but not on another. The definition I provided, disadvantaging someone on the basis of race, but they have another reason that relieves that dissonance."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# Nope, I read an article in nature medicine that invested this question in the UK population. I'm just using the Socratic method."
"#USER# #USER# LOL, yeah, if it weren't for the EPIC mismanagement tings would have been fine."

#USER# #USER# Because you made the charge —now back it up or shut it up. Your choice.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# No one said that. We're just justified in SAYING it was LIKELY X. Sorry I had to go allcaps, but you apparently missed that word. And that is scientific. You make a hypothesis based on observations and then test the hypothesis."
#USER# #USER# When you start calling people liars for not reason you've lost.
#USER# Like watching someone walking back into a burning building.
#USER# #USER# I realize it's not all. There may be a broad sense of the word racist where the stereotypic depictions would fit. I'm just not convinced that eliminating them serves a greater good than preserving them.
"#USER# Yes, they messed up the Hubble, but there was the possibility of repairs and upgrades. The JW has many other things that could go wrong and no realistic chance of fixing them."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I agree applying 2020 standards to Geisel is inappropriate. He should be judged in his context. However, even in his context he would be regarded as an overt racist. More importantly, are all of his works appropriate for children?"
"#USER# #USER# I don't know where you live, but we have vaccines, treatments, mask mandates and a ton of research from multiple independent sources that confirm their efficacy."

#USER# I have never HATED  US president SO much!
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# He a psychologist by training, but apparently quite a student of phil. He makes his case for value for life and a God as the manifestation of a noble human struggle through suffering. Or, at least that was my take. What do I know? I'm an atheist."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# It's been nearly 30 since I've read anything by Aquinas. Modern phil. of ethics still look at him, but modern philosophers, even most Thomists don't consider his arguments unassailable. So he can't simply be referred to ipse dixit."
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# No more than a cell can be deprived of life or nourishment. You are begging the question of the fetus's personhood without establishing a basis for its personhood.
#USER# #USER# According to common sense in order for mask mandates to work asthma boy should have been more cooperative and less punchable.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# We evidently agree on the bottom line, but for different reasons. Bodily autonomy is something that we might value, but I don’t see it as an insurmountable value. A pro-life person would have to show me there is a countervailing value in preserving the fetus to term."
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# As I've reiterated 3-4 times before in this thread. My objection to the young man's behaviour has nothing to do with the law and everything to do with our shared responsibility toward one another.
#USER# #USER# #USER# Herd immunity is when the transmission rate is less than 1. That number exists somewhere short of 100%.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Altruism is down stream from self interest. Ultimately what motivates moral behavior is self-interest, but that does not preclude sincere altruism and love."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# It's a reasonable question. If your position is, there is nothing anyone can say that makes them morally, civilly, or legally liable for any harms —then say so clearly. I think that is an extremist position. Or are you saying they are responsible but it's hard to establish?"
"#USER# #USER# #USER# Your argument is a slippery slope argument, and we already determine responsibility on the basis of what a reasonable person would know, so it is demonstrably wrong. I'm not proposing anything new here."
#USER# The admittedly reductionist short story is —it's used to maintain a reliable ally in the region from which the USA and allies could project power from if necessary.
"#USER# #USER# Don't see your point or how in anyway it's related to what I wrote above. I should hope that pull overs for unregistered plates, that result in warrant enforcement, that result in physical struggles, that result in attempted getaways by car, are quite rare."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# ""Because this HYPOTHESIS is valid to getting to the bottom of a GLOBAL pandemic."" What hypothesis? The only difference if the virus is reset in Russia is anti Russian bigotry is not a thing. But it still wouldn't help working with Russian scientists to gather evidence."
#USER# Hopefully she won’t get uppity and start thinking for herself like the last one…
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Doing business in China is not illegal. A president soliciting and accepting help from foreign powers is. Mueller didn't charge because there was not evidence  that Trump et al knew it was illegal. That's it. Of course by 2019 and Ukraine they had NO excuse whatsoever.
#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Noting you're not answering the question. You're just begging the question of racism. Do you think if I showed you an image of a random person you would have no idea where their ancestors were from?

#USER# #USER# #USER# I think med. experts have been clear about just a cloth is pretty useless from near the beginning.
#USER# #USER# #USER# That affirms my point. You have to believe in ghosts to justify an anti abortion position. And there's no basis for that in the bible. And there are logical problems— when does the soul enter the fetus? It sure isn't at conception unless identical twins only have half souls.
"#USER# #USER# Murder means intentional illegal killing of a person. Abortion remains legal, and a fetus is not a person. So you are demonstrably wrong. If you want to be right you have to justify why we should call a fetus a person and why we should call unintentional killing of one murder."
"#USER# #USER# If you look at my other comments you'll know this is not my claim. I'm taking a Freudian view that your affinity for religious descriptors betrays your religious view of your ideological position. For me, using religious tags would be abhorrent."

#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Thank you for underscoring my initial point. Appeals to popular opinion are fallacious. In order to justify prohibiting abortion people invoke supernatural beings. I don't have to do that to explain why theft or assault is wrong. Is what a fetus looks like important?

"#USER# #USER# #USER# What you've said only makes sense if you have already jumped to the conclusion that this is at odds with the ""corporate narrative"". It's just that the data are predictably going to be misunderstood by those who don't have experience analyzing data."
"#USER# Yeah, inflation is a problem in many countries right now. Obviously all Biden's fault"
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I suspect you're a victim of the same phenomenon. I don't believe that race is a biological phenomenon. I believe it has biological factors, social factors, and psychological factors and they are interacting over time in a social context."
"#USER# #USER# Yes, moderates are being silenced. Good point, Sierra. Though I have to reject your category of ""real  victims"". Positive progress is a group effort. That's why excluding perspectives is counterproductive."
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Yeah, avoiding fair questions, and mocking people is hilarious."
"#USER# This is like debunking climate change claims by, instead of going to environmental scientists, citing Al Gore mistakes."
#USER# #USER# WOW! Assuming you’re not just trolling. Wow!!! It’s amazing how adults function so detached from reality.
"#USER# #USER# Actually there was no better precedent of claim to the land after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. There wasn't a country there. It's small compared to Canada for example. Point being, it's not like they didn't know where the Palestinians were if they wanted to ""cleanse them""."
#USER# #USER# The standard definition of a person precludes blastocysts and fetuses. This is not remotely an even playing field. It only seems like pro life positions have a seat at the table because they have manipulated the dialogue.
"#USER# #USER# The overly simple answer is large corporations weigh too heavily in US politics by granting political favors and campaign funds to candidates that return the favor in various ways, like not enacting widely popular programs."
#USER# #USER# #USER# There's absolutely no point in claiming falsely he had a gun if there is no gun with finger prints on it in the scene. People who claim otherwise lack logical thinking abilities.
"#USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# I wonder if you would have advised a ground war in Japan that would likely have killed millions? Who decides? The moral agents involved. To make an argument against abortion you would have to make a reasoned, evidence based appeal to moral principles."
"#USER# I can see why. It's an evidence based claim that refutes the IQ's are culturally biased position. The scientists who study these things are psychometric nerds who generally  don't care about culture-wars. Jensen was smeared, but I think he was a good scientist."
#USER# #USER# #USER# I'm not making the argument that pharmaceutical companies are not making money. I have heard about some insider trading from congressmen. I hope they are sanctioned. Have a good day.
"#USER# I'd only be interested in the data— does it reduce harm?If-yes, I'm for it. If no, I'm against it. Indeterminate? More research. Life is simple really. #HASHTAG#"
"#USER# #USER# And in order for your claim to be true it would require a GLOBAL psychopathic conspiracy of people in the medical profession, who, on average, are motivated to enter their professions out of a desire to care for others. 
ASININE!"

"#USER# #USER# My comment's ""word soup""? After you wrote this--&gt; ""No explanation is necessary since it IS and that establishes it's own significance moral or otherwise is totally insignificant."" Wow! I've been arguing moral philosophy for 15+ years. U seem new here."
